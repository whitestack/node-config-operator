# Node Config Operator

Operator that configures nodes that are part of a Kubernetes cluster. Used in
[our](https://www.whitestack.com) clusters as a minimal replacement for Ansible.

## Description

This operator configures multiple parts of a Ubuntu server, such as:

- Configuration of kernel parameters (via sysctl)
- Loading of kernel modules
- Creation of systemd units and systemd overrides
- Writing blocks of text to files
- Installation of apt packages

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- A dedicated namespace
- If any kind of pod security admission policy is enforced, ensure that
  nodeconfig operator has an unrestricted policy.

### Deploy using helm

1. Install the chart with:
   `helm upgrade --install --create-namespace -n nco-system nco oci://ghcr.io/whitestack/charts/node-config-operator`

1. The operator will start, but no changes will be applied to hosts until a
   valid `NodeConfig` CR is applied.

A sample CR can be found
[here](/config/samples/configuration_v1beta2_nodeconfig.yaml)

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes
[Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses
[Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources
untile the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

1. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new
   terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or
CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

## Dev notes

You can run:

```sh
make dev
```

To generate the controller types, manifests, update the chart and autogenerated
documentation. You **must** run this command before every push.

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
